# MachineLearningGraphs

The graphs come handy whenever we deal with relations between the objects.
This course, focused on learning, presents methods involving two main sources 
of graphs in ML: 1) graphs coming 
from networks, e.g., social, biological, technology, etc. and 2) graphs coming 
from flat (often vision) data, where a graph serves as a useful nonparametric 
basis and is an effective data
representation for tasks as spectral clustering, manifold or semi-supervised learning. 
We also discussed online decision-making on graphs, suitable for recommender systems
or online advertising.
The practical sessions provide hands-on experience on interesting applications 
(e.g., online face recognizer) and state-of-the-art graphs processing tools (e.g., GraphLab).
